# **R25W118994A - Godot Project Setup and Dependencies**

**Status:** Active (Paused) | **Date:** June 24, 2025

## **Context**
Guildmaster's Ledger requires Godot Engine integration for 3D client visualization. Need to embed Godot as library within Elixir applications using libgodot and Membrane Unifex NIFs.

## **Decision**
Implement Godot integration using libgodot via Membrane Unifex NIFs. Create aria_godot umbrella app with V-Sekai's libgodot bundling approach for cross-platform compatibility.

## **Success Criteria**
aria_godot app compiles successfully on Linux/macOS/Windows, libgodot shared library integrates properly, Unifex NIF compilation works, basic GodotInstance lifecycle functions.

## **Timeline**
Complete project setup by September 15, validate cross-platform compilation by September 20.

## **Next Steps**
1. Create aria_godot umbrella application with Unifex dependency
2. Integrate V-Sekai libgodot bundled libraries
3. Configure cross-platform build system
4. Set up basic NIF compilation and testing
5. Validate GodotInstance creation and cleanup
