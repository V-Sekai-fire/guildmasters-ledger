## **Context**
Elixir NIF interface complete, now need comprehensive Godot operations. Requires scene tree traversal, node manipulation, property operations, and resource management for Guildmaster's Ledger visualization.

Implement comprehensive Godot operations API with scene manipulation, node operations, and resource handling. Focus on Guild Hall visualization and hero movement tracking.

## **Success Criteria**
Scene tree traversal works, nodes created/modified/deleted, properties get/set correctly, Guild Hall visualization functional, hero movement tracked in real-time.

## **Timeline**
Complete Godot operations by October 15, integrate with Guildmaster's Ledger by October 20.

## **Next Steps**
1. Implement scene tree traversal and manipulation
2. Add node creation, modification, deletion functions
3. Create property getting and setting capabilities
4. Implement scene loading and saving operations
5. Integrate with Guildmaster's Ledger for hero visualization
