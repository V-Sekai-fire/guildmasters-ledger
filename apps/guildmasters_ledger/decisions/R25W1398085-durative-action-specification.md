# **R25W1398085 - Durative Action Specification**

**Status:** Completed | **Date:** 2025-06-28

## **Context**
Need comprehensive durative action specification for HTN planning with temporal constraints, entity capabilities, and hierarchical decomposition supporting autonomous hero quest execution.

## **Decision**
Implement durative actions with 8 temporal patterns: instant actions, floating duration, deadline constraints, calculated start/end times, fixed intervals, and validation. Support entity-based resource management and Sussman anomaly resolution.

## **Success Criteria**
All 8 temporal patterns functional, entity capabilities system operational, hierarchical decomposition working, temporal constraints resolved, Sussman anomalies handled.

## **Timeline**
Complete durative action implementation by September 15, validate temporal patterns by September 18.

## **Next Steps**
1. Implement 8 temporal patterns with ISO 8601 duration support
2. Create entity capability system with traits (cooking, adventuring, etc.)
3. Build hierarchical task decomposition for complex quest workflows
4. Implement temporal constraint solver for dependency resolution
5. Test autonomous hero execution with temporal constraint propagation
