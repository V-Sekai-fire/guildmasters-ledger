**Status:** Completed | **Date:** 2025-06-28

## **Context**
Need practical implementation guide for HTN planning in Guildmaster's Ledger. Must provide working examples, API usage patterns, and integration approaches for autonomous hero execution.

## **Decision**
Create comprehensive implementation guide with working examples, API patterns, and integration strategies. Focus on practical usage for autonomous hero quest execution and temporal planning.

## **Success Criteria**
Working examples functional, API patterns documented, integration approaches clear, autonomous hero execution demonstrated, temporal planning integrated.

## **Timeline**
Complete implementation guide by September 15, create working examples by September 18.

## **Next Steps**
1. Create working HTN domain examples for hero quests
2. Document API usage patterns for plan/4 and run_lazy/4
3. Implement entity registration and capability system
4. Build temporal constraint examples with Sussman anomalies
5. Create integration examples with Guildmaster's Ledger
