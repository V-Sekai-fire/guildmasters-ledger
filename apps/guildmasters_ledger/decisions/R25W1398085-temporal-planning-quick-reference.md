# **R25W1398085 - Temporal Planning Quick Reference**

**Status:** Completed | **Date:** 2025-06-28

## **Context**
Guildmaster's Ledger requires temporal planning for autonomous AI heroes. Need comprehensive reference for HTN planning concepts, durative actions, and temporal constraints.

## **Decision**
Create unified temporal planning specification with durative actions, entity capabilities, and hierarchical task decomposition for autonomous hero quest execution.

## **Success Criteria**
Heroes execute complex multi-step quests with temporal ordering, resolve paradoxical dependencies, achieve <5ms planning latency for real-time gameplay.

## **Timeline**
Complete temporal planning integration by September 15, validate with hero quest scenarios by September 20.

## **Next Steps**
1. Define hero entity capabilities and quest action specifications
2. Implement temporal constraint solver for quest dependencies
3. Create player intervention points in temporal planning workflow
4. Integrate with HTN planner for hierarchical quest decomposition
5. Benchmark planning performance for real-time hero coordination
