# **R25W1398085 - Understanding HTN Planning Concepts**

**Status:** Completed | **Date:** 2025-06-28

## **Context**
HTN planning differs fundamentally from imperative programming. Players make strategic decisions while AI heroes execute complex plans autonomously through hierarchical task decomposition.

## **Decision**
Adopt HTN planning paradigm where goals are decomposed into tasks, tasks into actions. Actions are direct state transformations, methods handle goal decomposition, entities provide capabilities.

## **Success Criteria**
Clear distinction between planning vs programming established, autonomous hero execution works, temporal constraints resolved, Sussman anomaly handling implemented.

## **Timeline**
Complete HTN concept integration by September 15, validate autonomous execution by September 20.

## **Next Steps**
1. Implement Hero GenServer with goal processing
2. Create Quest Board GenServer for quest generation
3. Build in-memory world entity communication
4. Test autonomous hero quest completion
5. Validate temporal constraint resolution
