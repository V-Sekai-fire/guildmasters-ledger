# **R25W1900002 - README Content Migration to Decision Records**

**Status:** Approved | **Date:** September 6, 2025

## **Context**
README.md grew too complex with detailed sections better suited as architectural decision records. Need to migrate all detailed content into decisions/ directory while keeping README as concise one-page overview.

## **Decision**
Migrate all detailed sections from README.md into this ADR document and simplify README to essential information only. Move implementation details, API documentation, and roadmap to dedicated decision records.

## **Success Criteria**
README remains clean and focused on essential information, detailed documentation properly organized in decisions/, easier maintenance of both README and detailed docs.

## **Timeline**
Complete migration by September 8, update README by September 9, validate documentation structure by September 10.

## **Next Steps**
1. Extract detailed sections from README.md to this ADR
2. Simplify README to one-page overview with essential information
3. Update all references to point to appropriate decision records
4. Ensure all implementation details are properly documented in decisions/
5. Validate that README provides clear entry point to detailed documentation
