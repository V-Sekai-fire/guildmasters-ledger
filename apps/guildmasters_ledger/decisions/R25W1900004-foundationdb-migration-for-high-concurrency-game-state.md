# **R25W1900004 - FoundationDB Migration Strategy**

**Status:** Proposed | **Date:** September 6, 2025

## **Context**
Guildmaster's Ledger requires high-concurrency storage supporting 1000+ simultaneous heroes. Current PostgreSQL implementation uses Ecto schemas with predicate routing for HTN planning compatibility.

## **Decision**
Migrate from PostgreSQL to FoundationDB for high-concurrency game state storage. FoundationDB's distributed key-value architecture excels at concurrent operations with sub-millisecond latency.

## **Success Criteria**
Sub-millisecond latency for 1000+ concurrent hero operations, maintain HTN planning API compatibility, zero data loss during migration, linear performance scaling validated.

## **Timeline**
Complete migration by October 1, 2025. Week 1: Environment setup, Week 2: Proof of concept, Week 3: Core migration, Week 4: Production deployment.

## **Next Steps**
1. Set up FoundationDB development environment and cluster
2. Implement EctoFoundationDB adapter with tenant configuration
3. Test existing schemas with FoundationDB backend
4. Validate HTN planner compatibility with adapted queries
5. Performance benchmark against PostgreSQL baseline
