# **R25W1900007 - PostgreSQL Technology Analysis and Evaluation**

**Status:** Proposed | **Date:** September 6, 2025

## **Context**

Guild Master's Ledger requires robust storage for high-concurrency game state with 1000+ hero operations, complex queries, and ACID compliance for player progression data.

## **Decision**

Evaluate PostgreSQL as primary storage solution leveraging existing implementation, benchmarking current performance, and assessing scalability for LitRPG game requirements.

## **Success Criteria**

Demonstrate <5ms query latency for hero state operations, support 1000+ concurrent connections, validate ACID compliance for player data integrity, confirm HTN planner integration compatibility.

## **Timeline**

Complete PostgreSQL analysis by September 10, benchmark performance by September 12, document migration path by September 14.

## **Next Steps**

1. Benchmark current PostgreSQL implementation against game workloads
2. Analyze query performance for hero state operations and temporal data
3. Evaluate connection pooling and concurrency handling
4. Assess backup/restore capabilities for player progression data
5. Document PostgreSQL-specific optimizations for HTN planning queries
