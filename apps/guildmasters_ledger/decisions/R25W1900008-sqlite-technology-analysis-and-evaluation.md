# **R25W1900008 - SQLite Technology Analysis and Evaluation**

**Status:** Proposed | **Date:** September 6, 2025

## **Context**

Guild Master's Ledger needs evaluation of SQLite as lightweight embedded storage alternative for single-player modes, development environments, and resource-constrained deployments.

## **Decision**

Assess SQLite for embedded game storage focusing on file-based operations, concurrent access limitations, and suitability for LitRPG game state management in constrained environments.

## **Success Criteria**

Validate SQLite performance for hero operations in single-writer scenarios, assess WAL mode for improved concurrency, evaluate embedded deployment feasibility, document concurrency limitations for multiplayer features.

## **Timeline**

Complete SQLite evaluation by September 10, test embedded deployment scenarios by September 12, document deployment constraints by September 14.

## **Next Steps**

1. Test SQLite performance with hero state operations and temporal queries
2. Evaluate WAL mode for improved concurrent read performance
3. Assess file-based storage for development and testing environments
4. Document SQLite limitations for high-concurrency multiplayer scenarios
5. Compare SQLite vs PostgreSQL for single-player LitRPG game modes
