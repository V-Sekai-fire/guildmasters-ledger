# **R25W1900009 - FoundationDB Technology Analysis and Evaluation**

**Status:** Proposed | **Date:** September 6, 2025

## **Context**

Guild Master's Ledger requires evaluation of FoundationDB for distributed game state storage with multi-version concurrency control and horizontal scaling capabilities for high-concurrency hero operations.

## **Decision**

Analyze FoundationDB as distributed storage solution focusing on MVCC performance, cluster management complexity, and integration with existing Elixir/Ecto infrastructure for LitRPG game state.

## **Success Criteria**

Validate FoundationDB performance for 1000+ concurrent hero operations, assess cluster deployment complexity, confirm Ecto adapter stability, evaluate operational overhead vs PostgreSQL.

## **Timeline**

Complete FoundationDB analysis by September 10, test cluster deployment by September 12, benchmark performance by September 14.

## **Next Steps**

1. Evaluate FoundationDB cluster setup and management complexity
2. Test MVCC performance with concurrent hero state operations
3. Assess Ecto adapter compatibility and query performance
4. Compare FoundationDB vs PostgreSQL for distributed game scenarios
5. Document operational requirements and scaling characteristics
