# **R25W1900010 - Implementation and Migration Strategy**

**Status:** Proposed | **Date:** September 6, 2025

## **Context**

Guild Master's Ledger requires comprehensive migration strategy from current storage to selected technology, ensuring zero-downtime migration and backward compatibility for player data.

## **Decision**

Develop phased migration approach with rollback capabilities, prioritizing PostgreSQL as baseline with FoundationDB as future distributed option, maintaining SQLite for development environments.

## **Success Criteria**

Complete migration with zero data loss, validate all hero operations post-migration, maintain <5ms performance, ensure backward compatibility for existing player progression data.

## **Timeline**

Design migration strategy by September 15, implement data migration scripts by September 18, validate migration by September 20.

## **Next Steps**

1. Design database schema migration scripts with rollback capabilities
2. Implement data transformation pipelines for hero state and temporal data
3. Create migration validation tests for data integrity
4. Develop zero-downtime migration procedures
5. Document operational procedures for production deployment
