# **R25W1900011 - Cost Analysis and Total Cost of Ownership**

**Status:** Proposed | **Date:** September 6, 2025

## **Context**

Guild Master's Ledger requires comprehensive TCO analysis comparing PostgreSQL, SQLite, and FoundationDB for LitRPG game storage, including infrastructure, development, and operational costs.

## **Decision**

Conduct detailed cost-benefit analysis prioritizing PostgreSQL for production with SQLite for development, evaluating FoundationDB for future scaling needs with focus on operational complexity vs performance benefits.

## **Success Criteria**

Document TCO comparison with 3-year projections, identify cost-optimal solution for initial launch, validate infrastructure requirements for 1000+ concurrent users.

## **Timeline**

Complete cost analysis by September 15, document TCO recommendations by September 18, finalize technology selection by September 20.

## **Next Steps**

1. Analyze infrastructure costs for each storage technology
2. Evaluate development and maintenance effort requirements
3. Assess operational complexity and team expertise needs
4. Project scaling costs for user growth scenarios
5. Document cost-benefit analysis with technology recommendations
