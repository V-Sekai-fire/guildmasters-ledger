# **R25W1900012 - Temporal Planning for Autonomous AI Heroes in LitRPG Guild Master**

**Status:** Proposed | **Date:** September 6, 2025

## **Context**

Guild Master's Ledger requires temporal planning for autonomous AI heroes executing complex multi-step quests with temporal dependencies, Sussman anomaly resolution, and player strategic interventions.

## **Decision**

Adapt unified durative action specification (R25W1398085) for LitRPG game mechanics with hero entities, quest temporal constraints, and real-time planning integration.

## **Success Criteria**

Heroes execute multi-step quests with temporal ordering, resolve paradoxical dependencies, achieve <5ms planning latency for real-time gameplay, support 1000+ concurrent hero operations.

## **Timeline**

Complete temporal planning integration by September 15, validate with hero quest scenarios by September 20, optimize for September Jam submission.

## **Next Steps**

1. Define hero entity capabilities and quest action specifications using durative action patterns
2. Implement temporal constraint solver for quest dependencies and Sussman anomaly resolution
3. Create player intervention points in temporal planning workflow
4. Integrate with HTN planner for hierarchical quest decomposition
5. Benchmark planning performance for real-time hero coordination requirements
