<!-- @adr_serial R25T0079D35 -->

**Status:** Deferred  
**Date:** June 15, 2025  
**Closure Date:** June 21, 2025  
**Extracted from:** ADR-075 Task 10

## Context

Task 10 from ADR-075 requires implementing `AriaEngine.Timeline` module with interval-based storage that uses the ~~Path Consistency (PC-2) algorithm~~ (Replaced with MiniZinc v0.2.0) for optimal Simple Temporal Network (STN) solving. This implementation must integrate findings from multiple ADRs regarding Allen's interval algebra, usability improvements, and the agent vs entity distinction.

### Key Requirements from ADR Review

**From ADR-040 (Temporal Constraint Solver Selection):**

- ~~PC-2 algorithm~~ (Replaced with MiniZinc v0.2.0) is mandatory for STN solving
- Must handle temporal constraint networks efficiently
- Algorithm provides optimal constraint propagation

**From ADR-045 (Allen's Interval Algebra):**

- Implement usability improvements to Allen's interval notation
- Provide fluent APIs for interval relationships
- Support user-friendly relation names and i18n
- Enable pipeline-based constraint building
- Add semantic sugar for agents/entities

**From ADR-037 (Timeline-based vs Durative Actions):**

- Timeline planning context for action scheduling
- Integration with existing workflow systems

## Decision

## Progress Notes

**June 21, 2025 - Segment Closure:**
This ADR is being deferred as part of the temporal planning segment closure. The core temporal planning infrastructure has been successfully implemented through HybridCoordinatorV2 with STN temporal strategies, providing the essential functionality needed for the current segment. This comprehensive timeline module with PC-2 implementation represents future enhancement work that can be pursued in subsequent development phases.

**Current Status:** Deferred to future development phases. Core temporal planning needs are met by existing HybridCoordinatorV2 infrastructure.
