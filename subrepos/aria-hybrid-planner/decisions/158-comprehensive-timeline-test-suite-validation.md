<!-- @adr_serial R25W007B127 -->

**Status:** Active (Paused)  
**Date:** June 23, 2025  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

## Context

After resolving individual timeline testing issues (namespace aliasing, STN consistency, cross-app dependencies), a comprehensive validation of the entire timeline test suite is needed to ensure end-to-end temporal reasoning functionality works correctly.

**Current State:**

- Individual timeline testing issues being addressed in parallel ADRs
- Need systematic validation of complete timeline workflow
- Integration testing across timeline, bridge, and STN layers required
- End-to-end temporal reasoning validation missing

**Integration Points:**

- Timeline → Bridge → STN constraint flow
- Cross-app integration with scheduler and hybrid planner
- Agent/entity capability management with temporal constraints
- Multi-timeline coordination and synchronization

## Decision

Implement comprehensive end-to-end validation of the timeline test suite to ensure all temporal reasoning components work together correctly and provide reliable development feedback.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 5: Performance and Reliability Testing (Day 4-5)

**Scalability Testing:**

- [ ] Test timeline performance with hundreds of intervals
- [ ] Validate STN solving performance with large constraint sets
- [ ] Test memory usage and resource management
- [ ] Verify temporal reasoning accuracy under load

**Reliability and Edge Cases:**

- [ ] Test timeline behavior with edge case temporal constraints
- [ ] Validate error handling and recovery scenarios
- [ ] Test concurrent timeline operations and thread safety
- [ ] Verify deterministic results across multiple test runs

## Success Criteria

### Critical Success

- [ ] All timeline test suites pass consistently (100% pass rate)
- [ ] End-to-end temporal reasoning workflows validated
- [ ] Cross-app integration tests demonstrate proper functionality
- [ ] Performance meets requirements for realistic workloads

### Quality Success

- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all timeline functionality
- [ ] Clear test organization and documentation
- [ ] Fast test execution for development feedback (<30 seconds total)
- [ ] Reliable test results without flakiness or non-determinism

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Test Infrastructure Validation

1. Ensure all individual ADR fixes are integrated properly
2. Validate test helper configuration and dependencies
3. Verify test isolation and independence
4. Configure test execution environment

### Step 2: Systematic Workflow Testing

1. Test each major timeline workflow end-to-end
2. Validate integration points between components
3. Test error handling and edge cases
4. Verify performance and scalability

### Step 3: Cross-App Integration Validation

1. Test timeline integration with each dependent app
2. Validate interface contracts and data flow
3. Test error propagation and handling
4. Verify end-to-end system functionality
