# ADR-165: Decision Record Task List Separation

<!-- @adr_serial R25W0165A7B -->

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

## Context

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the project had become cluttered with extensive task lists, implementation phases, and project management checklists. This mixing of decision documentation with task tracking created several problems:

**Current Issues:**

- **Decision Clarity**: Core architectural decisions were buried under implementation details
- **Document Length**: ADRs became excessively long and difficult to navigate
- **Mixed Purposes**: Documents served both as decision records and project management tools
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Task lists required constant updates as implementation progressed
- **Reader Confusion**: New team members struggled to understand actual decisions vs. implementation tasks

**Examples of Problematic Content:**

- Phase-based implementation plans with detailed task checklists
- Success criteria with checkbox lists (`- [ ]` and `- [x]`)
- Quality metrics with task items
- Step-by-step implementation procedures
- Project timeline tracking within decision documents

**Impact on Decision Records:**

- ADRs lost focus on the "what" and "why" of decisions
- Implementation details overshadowed architectural rationale
- Documents became project artifacts rather than decision documentation
- Historical decision context became harder to extract

## Decision

**Establish clear separation between decision documentation and task tracking by removing implementation task lists from ADRs while preserving technical decision content.**

ADRs should focus exclusively on:

- **Context**: Why the decision was needed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this approach was chosen
- **Consequences**: Expected outcomes and trade-offs
- **Alternatives**: Options considered and rejected

Implementation details should be moved to appropriate project management tools or separate implementation documents.

### Rationale

1. **Single Responsibility**: ADRs should document decisions, not track implementation
2. **Clarity**: Readers can quickly understand architectural choices without implementation noise
3. **Maintainability**: Decision records remain stable while implementation evolves
4. **Historical Value**: Future developers can understand past decisions without outdated task lists
5. **Tool Separation**: Use appropriate tools for different purposes (ADRs for decisions, project management tools for tasks)

## Implementation Approach

### Content Transformation Pattern

**Remove:**

```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Implementation (Week 1)
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] Task 4
- [ ] Task 5

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
```

**Replace with:**

```markdown
## Implementation Approach

The implementation will focus on core functionality integration with existing systems.

### Key Implementation Areas
- Core functionality development
- System integration points
- Performance optimization

### Expected Outcomes
- All tests pass
- Performance meets requirements
- Clean integration with existing systems
```

### Transformation Guidelines

1. **Preserve Technical Content**: Keep code examples, architectural diagrams, and technical specifications
2. **Convert Task Lists**: Transform checkbox lists into descriptive implementation approaches
3. **Maintain Decision Context**: Preserve all decision rationale and alternatives considered
4. **Simplify Success Criteria**: Convert checkbox lists to outcome descriptions
5. **Remove Project Management**: Eliminate phase timelines, resource allocation, and task assignments

### Content Categories

**Keep in ADRs:**

- Decision context and motivation
- Technical architecture and design
- Code examples and specifications
- Trade-offs and consequences
- Alternative approaches considered
- Related decisions and dependencies

**Move Out of ADRs:**

- Implementation task lists
- Project timelines and phases
- Resource assignments
- Progress tracking
- Quality assurance checklists
- Detailed step-by-step procedures

## Application Results

Applied this technique to 5 major decision documents:

1. **ADR-161**: Bridge Validation Implementation
2. **ADR-163**: DateTime Type Consistency  
3. **ADR-153**: STN Fixed-Point Constraint Prohibition
4. **ADR-154**: Timeline Module Namespace Aliasing Fixes
5. **ADR-152**: Complete Temporal Relations System Implementation

**Improvements Achieved:**

- Reduced document length by 30-50% while preserving technical content
- Improved decision clarity and readability
- Eliminated outdated task tracking information
- Focused documents on architectural decisions rather than project management

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved Clarity**: ADRs focus on decisions rather than implementation details
- **Better Maintainability**: Decision records remain stable as implementation evolves
- **Enhanced Readability**: Shorter, more focused documents are easier to navigate
- **Historical Value**: Future developers can understand past decisions without implementation noise
- **Tool Separation**: Clear distinction between decision documentation and project management

### Negative

- **Implementation Tracking**: Need alternative tools/processes for task management
- **Initial Effort**: Requires review and cleanup of existing ADRs
- **Process Change**: Team must adapt to new ADR writing guidelines

### Neutral

- **Content Migration**: Implementation details may need to be captured elsewhere if still relevant
- **Template Updates**: ADR templates should reflect new content guidelines

## Related ADRs

- **Future ADR**: ADR Template Standardization (should incorporate these guidelines)
- **Process**: This technique can be applied to other documentation types beyond ADRs

## Monitoring

- **Document Quality**: ADR readability and focus on decisions
- **Team Adoption**: Compliance with new ADR content guidelines
- **Decision Clarity**: Ability to quickly understand architectural choices from ADRs

## Implementation Notes

### ADR Content Guidelines

**Decision-Focused Structure:**

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Context
[Why this decision was needed]

## Decision
[What was decided]

## Implementation Approach
[High-level approach without task lists]

## Consequences
[Expected outcomes and trade-offs]

## Alternatives Considered
[Options evaluated and rejected]
```

**Avoid in ADRs:**

- Checkbox task lists (`- [ ]` and `- [x]`)
- Phase-based implementation plans
- Detailed project timelines
- Resource allocation details
- Progress tracking information

**Include in ADRs:**

- Technical architecture decisions
- Code examples and specifications
- Design rationale and trade-offs
- Alternative approaches considered
- Integration points and dependencies

This approach ensures ADRs serve their primary purpose: documenting architectural decisions for future reference and understanding.
