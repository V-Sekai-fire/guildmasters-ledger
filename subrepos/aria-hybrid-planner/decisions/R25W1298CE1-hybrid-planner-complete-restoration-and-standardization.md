# R25W1298CE1: Hybrid Planner Complete Restoration and Standardization

<!-- @adr_serial R25W1298CE1 -->

**Status:** Active  
**Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Blocking ARC Prize work)  
**Timeline:** 2 weeks (June 24 - July 8, 2025)

## Context

The hybrid planner is currently in a non-functional state that blocks ARC Prize development:

**Critical Issues Identified:**

- **Zero test coverage**: All tests disabled (`.disabled` extensions)
- **Compilation warnings**: Type violations and unused variables in `lazy_execution.ex`
- **Missing R25W091EA37 standardization**: Legacy method registration patterns still in use
- **No functional verification**: Cannot confirm basic planning workflow works

**Dependency Chain:**
ARC Prize ‚Üí Hybrid Planner ‚Üí Engine Core + Temporal Planner

**Git Commit Analysis:**
Previous work shows 40+ planning commits with minimal implementation, indicating need for focused, capped restoration scope to avoid analysis paralysis.

## Decision

Implement complete hybrid planner restoration using comprehensive mocking strategy to isolate external dependencies and interfaces, enabling focused testing and development in two phases with strict scope limits before any ARC Prize work begins.

**Core Strategy: Mock-First Development**

- Mock all external interfaces (aria_engine_core, aria_temporal_planner, aria_scheduler)
- Create test doubles for complex dependencies (STN solver, MiniZinc integration)
- Isolate hybrid planner logic from external system complexity
- Enable independent testing and verification of core functionality

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Mock Infrastructure and Core Restoration (Week 1: June 24-30)

**Day 1-2: Mock Infrastructure Setup**

## ARC Prize Integration Readiness

**Pre-ARC Checklist (Must be 100% complete):**

- [ ] `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` passes with mocked interfaces
- [ ] `mix test` passes with comprehensive mock-based coverage
- [ ] Core planning workflow: Domain ‚Üí Goals ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Execution (fully tested with mocks)
- [ ] R25W091EA37 standardization implemented and validated with mock scenarios
- [ ] Mock-based integration tests covering all external interface contracts
- [ ] Documentation updated with new patterns and mock integration examples
- [ ] Sample domains working with new patterns in isolated test environment
- [ ] Dependency injection pattern ready for real system integration
- [ ] Mock-to-real integration strategy documented for ARC Prize phase

**Real Integration Strategy for ARC Phase:**

- [ ] Gradual replacement of mocks with real dependencies
- [ ] Integration testing with actual aria_engine_core and aria_temporal_planner
- [ ] Validation that mock contracts match real system interfaces
- [ ] Fallback to mock-based testing for complex integration scenarios

## Risk Mitigation

**High-Risk Areas:**

1. **Test restoration complexity**: Disabled tests may have deep integration issues
2. **Type system violations**: Current warnings indicate structural problems
3. **External dependency complexity**: Real system integration introduces unpredictable failures
4. **Mock-reality mismatch**: Mocks may not accurately represent real system behavior
5. **Timeline pressure**: 2 weeks is aggressive for complete restoration

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Mock-first development**: Eliminate external dependency complexity during restoration
- **Comprehensive mock coverage**: Create mocks for all external interfaces and edge cases
- **Daily compilation checks**: Ensure no regressions during development with mocked systems
- **Incremental test restoration**: Fix one test file at a time using controlled mock scenarios
- **Mock contract validation**: Document expected behaviors and validate against real systems later
- **Rollback plan**: Keep working branches for each phase with mock infrastructure preserved
- **Scope enforcement**: No feature additions beyond restoration requirements
- **Real integration deferral**: Postpone complex real system integration until ARC phase
- **Mock scenario library**: Build comprehensive test scenarios for all planning edge cases

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Complete:**

- Hybrid planner compiles cleanly and tests pass with comprehensive mocks
- Basic planning functionality verified end-to-end in isolated environment
- Mock-based integration contracts established and validated
- External dependency complexity eliminated from core development

**Phase 2 Complete:**

- R25W091EA37 standardization fully implemented with mock validation
- Module-based domain pattern functional in test environment
- Error handling standardized throughout with mock error scenarios
- Dependency injection pattern ready for real system integration
- Ready for ARC Prize domain integration with controlled complexity

**Overall Success:**

- Hybrid planner is 100% functional and tested independently of external systems
- Mock infrastructure provides reliable foundation for ARC Prize development
- Technical debt eliminated, not accumulated
- Complex external dependencies isolated and manageable
- Real integration strategy documented and ready for implementation

## Timeline Impact on ARC Prize

**Original ARC Timeline**: 2 weeks (July 8-22)
**New ARC Timeline**: 2 weeks (July 8-22) - **unchanged**
**Total Project Timeline**: 4 weeks (2 weeks restoration + 2 weeks ARC)

The restoration work is **prerequisite** to ARC success, not optional. Attempting ARC work with a broken hybrid planner would result in failure.

## Related ADRs

- **R25W091EA37**: Planner Standardization Open Problems (solutions to implement)
- **R25W113CC67**: Hybrid Planner Test Suite Restoration (previous attempt)
- **R25W130E6A7-175**: ARC Prize ADR series (dependent on this restoration)

## Consequences

**If Successful:**

- Hybrid planner becomes reliable, testable foundation for ARC Prize work
- Mock infrastructure enables rapid development and testing cycles
- R25W091EA37 standardization enables clean domain integration in controlled environment
- Technical debt eliminated rather than accumulated
- External dependency complexity managed and isolated
- Real integration path clearly defined and documented

**If Failed:**

- ARC Prize work cannot proceed due to untestable, complex system
- Technical debt continues to accumulate with external dependency entanglement
- Planning system remains unreliable and difficult to debug
- Mock-based development approach not established for future work

This restoration is the critical path to ARC Prize success.
