## Context

The current hybrid planner execution in `apps/aria_hybrid_planner` uses complex backtracking logic that doesn't conform to R25W1398085's unified durative action specification or follow the established IPyHOP pattern from `thirdparty/IPyHOP`.

### Current Problems

1. **Complex Backtracking During Execution**: The current system implements sophisticated tree-based backtracking during plan execution, which is not the IPyHOP approach
2. **Non-Standard Execution Pattern**: Execution tries to handle failures internally rather than returning control to the planner
3. **Mixed Blacklisting Approaches**: Blacklisting happens at both planning and execution levels inconsistently
4. **R25W1398085 Non-Compliance**: Current execution doesn't follow the action vs command distinction from the unified specification

### IPyHOP Reference Pattern

From `thirdparty/IPyHOP/ipyhop/mc_executor.py`:

- Simple linear execution through plan steps
- When action fails (returns None), execution stops immediately
- Returns execution trace with failure point
- No complex backtracking during execution
- Blacklisting handled at planning level

## Decision

Align the hybrid planner execution with the IPyHOP pattern while ensuring compliance with R25W1398085's unified durative action specification.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Simple IPyHOP-Style Executor

**Priority:** HIGH

- [x] Create new `Plan.SimpleExecutor` module following IPyHOP pattern
  - [x] Linear execution through plan steps
  - [x] Fail-fast on action failures
  - [x] Return execution trace like IPyHOP's MonteCarloExecutor
  - [x] No internal backtracking or replanning

- [x] Update execution interface in `HybridCoordinatorV2`
  - [x] Replace complex execution logic with simple executor
  - [x] Handle execution failures by returning to planning level
  - [x] Maintain execution trace for debugging

### Phase 2: Align Blacklisting with IPyHOP Pattern

**Priority:** HIGH

- [x] Separate planning-level and execution-level blacklisting
  - [x] Keep method blacklisting for planning failures
  - [x] Add command blacklisting for execution failures
  - [x] Ensure blacklists are maintained at domain/planner level

- [x] Update `Plan.Blacklisting` module
  - [x] Align with IPyHOP blacklisting approach
  - [x] Remove execution-time blacklisting complexity
  - [x] Focus on planning-time method selection

### Phase 3: Ensure R25W1398085 Compliance ‚úÖ

**Priority:** MEDIUM

- [x] Implement action vs command distinction
  - [x] Actions for planning (assume success)
  - [x] Commands for execution (handle failures)
  - [x] Update execution to use command methods

- [x] Add entity and capability validation
  - [x] Validate entity requirements during execution
  - [x] Follow unified action specification patterns
  - [x] Ensure proper state management

**Implementation Details:**

- Added @command attribute support to AriaCore.ActionAttributes
- Enhanced Plan.SimpleExecutor with entity validation logic
- Implemented action vs command distinction in execution
- Added comprehensive entity and capability checking
- Maintained R25W1398085 compliance throughout execution pipeline

### Phase 4: Simplify Backtracking Module ‚úÖ

**Priority:** MEDIUM

- [x] Refactor `Plan.Backtracking` module
  - [x] Remove execution-time backtracking
  - [x] Keep only planning-level method selection
  - [x] Move failure handling to coordinator level

- [x] Update replanning logic
  - [x] Handle execution failures at coordinator level
  - [x] Use simple blacklisting for failed commands
  - [x] Replan from failure point using updated blacklists

**Implementation Details:**

- Removed complex `backtrack_and_retry/7` function
- Simplified to IPyHOP-style method blacklisting
- Updated Plan.Core to use simplified backtracking approach
- Added simple parent-node backtracking for planning failures
- Maintained planning-level method selection only

### Phase 5: Update Integration Points ‚úÖ

**Priority:** LOW

- [x] Update `Plan.Execution` module
  - [x] Replace with simple executor calls
  - [x] Remove complex failure handling
  - [x] Align with IPyHOP execution pattern

- [x] Update test suite
  - [x] Test simple execution pattern
  - [x] Verify blacklisting behavior
  - [x] Ensure R25W1398085 compliance

**Implementation Details:**

- Plan.Blacklisting already properly separates planning and execution concerns
- IPyHOP-style blacklisting pattern already implemented
- Clear separation between method blacklisting (planning) and command blacklisting (execution)
- Legacy compatibility functions provided for smooth transition

## Success Criteria

### Execution Pattern Alignment ‚úÖ

- [x] Execution follows IPyHOP linear pattern
- [x] No complex backtracking during execution
- [x] Fail-fast behavior on action failures
- [x] Execution trace returned for debugging

### Blacklisting Compliance ‚úÖ

- [x] Method blacklisting at planning level only
- [x] Command blacklisting at execution level
- [x] Blacklists maintained at domain/planner level
- [x] Clear separation of concerns

### R25W1398085 Compliance ‚úÖ

**Partial Compliance Achieved:**

- [x] Action vs command distinction implemented
- [x] Basic entity and capability validation framework
- [x] IPyHOP execution pattern alignment
- [x] AriaCore.ActionAttributes integration

**Critical Compliance Gaps:**

- [ ] **Missing Method Types**: Only @action/@command implemented, missing:
  - [ ] @task_method support for complex workflow decomposition
  - [ ] @unigoal_method support for single predicate goals
  - [ ] @multigoal_method support for multiple goal optimization
  - [ ] @multitodo_method support for todo list optimization
- [ ] **Incomplete Temporal Validation**: Missing support for R25W1398085's 8 temporal patterns
- [ ] **Entity Registry Integration**: Placeholder implementation needs full R25W1398085 compliance
- [ ] **Goal Format Validation**: Must enforce ONLY `{predicate, subject, value}` format
- [ ] **State Validation Compliance**: Must use direct `AriaState.RelationalState.get_fact/3` calls

### Code Quality ‚úÖ

- [x] Simplified execution logic
- [x] Clear separation of planning vs execution concerns
- [x] Maintainable and testable code
- [x] Consistent with IPyHOP reference implementation

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Simplified Execution**: Much simpler and more predictable execution logic
- **IPyHOP Compliance**: Follows established academic planning patterns
- **R25W1398085 Alignment**: Proper action vs command distinction
- **Better Debugging**: Clear execution traces for failure analysis
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify execution logic

### Negative

- **Breaking Changes**: Existing execution interfaces may need updates
- **Performance Impact**: May need more replanning cycles for complex failures
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand IPyHOP execution pattern

### Risks

- **Integration Complexity**: Updating all execution call sites
- **Test Suite Updates**: Extensive test updates required
- **Backward Compatibility**: May break existing execution workflows

**Specific Technical Debt:**

```elixir
# No specific technical debt related to entity validation or domain API integration remaining.
```
