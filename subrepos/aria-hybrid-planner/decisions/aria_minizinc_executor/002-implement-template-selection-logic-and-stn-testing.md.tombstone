# ADR-002: Implement Template Selection Logic and STN Testing [TOMBSTONED]

**Status:** Superseded  
**Date:** 2025-06-23  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Tombstoned:** 2025-06-24  

## Tombstone Notice

This ADR has been **TOMBSTONED** and split into focused, single-responsibility ADRs:

- **ADR-002**: Implement Template Selection Logic (focused on template selection infrastructure)
- **ADR-007**: Implement True STN Mathematical Foundation (focused on STN domain implementation)

## Reason for Tombstoning

This ADR violated the single responsibility principle by combining two distinct concerns:

1. **Template Selection Infrastructure**: General mechanism for choosing appropriate templates
2. **STN Implementation Details**: Domain-specific mathematical foundation for STN problems

Following the "Targeted solutions over generalized systems" principle (INST-017), these concerns have been separated into dedicated ADRs with clear, focused responsibilities.

## Migration Path

**For Template Selection Work**: See ADR-002 (Implement Template Selection Logic)
**For STN Implementation Work**: See ADR-007 (Implement True STN Mathematical Foundation)

## Original Content

The original content of this ADR has been preserved in the git history. The key insights and implementation details have been distributed to the appropriate focused ADRs.

- **ADR-007**: Implement True STN Mathematical Foundation (successor)
- **ADR-001**: Extract MiniZinc Functionality into Dedicated App (parent)
- **ADR-003**: Separate Goal Solving and STN Problem Domains (related)
