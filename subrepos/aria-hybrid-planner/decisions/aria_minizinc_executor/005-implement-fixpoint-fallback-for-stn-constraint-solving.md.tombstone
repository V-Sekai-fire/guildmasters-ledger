# ADR-005: Implement Fixpoint Fallback for STN Constraint Solving and Tombstone Widget Assembly [TOMBSTONED]

**Status:** Superseded  
**Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Tombstoned:** 2025-06-24  

## Tombstone Notice

This ADR has been **TOMBSTONED** and split into focused, single-responsibility ADRs:

- **ADR-005**: Implement Fixpoint Fallback for STN Constraint Solving (focused on fallback solver implementation)
- **ADR-008**: Tombstone Widget Assembly Functionality (focused on code cleanup)

## Reason for Tombstoning

This ADR violated the single responsibility principle by combining two unrelated concerns:

1. **Fixpoint Fallback Implementation**: New feature for STN constraint solving
2. **Widget Assembly Tombstoning**: Cleanup task for removing unused functionality

Following the "Targeted solutions over generalized systems" principle (INST-017), these concerns have been separated into dedicated ADRs with clear, focused responsibilities.

## Migration Path

**For Fixpoint Fallback Work**: See ADR-005 (Implement Fixpoint Fallback for STN Constraint Solving)
**For Widget Assembly Cleanup**: See ADR-008 (Tombstone Widget Assembly Functionality)

## Original Content

The original content of this ADR has been preserved in the git history. The key insights and implementation details have been distributed to the appropriate focused ADRs.
