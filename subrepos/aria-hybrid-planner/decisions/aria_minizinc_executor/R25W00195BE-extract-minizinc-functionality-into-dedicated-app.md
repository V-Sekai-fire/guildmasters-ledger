# ADR-001: Extract MiniZinc Functionality into Dedicated App

<!-- @adr_serial R25W00195BE -->

**Status:** In Progress  
**Date:** 2025-06-23  
**Priority:** HIGH

## Context

MiniZinc constraint solving functionality is currently scattered across multiple apps in the umbrella project:

### Current Distribution

- **aria_engine_core**: Core MiniZinc executor, problem generator, and solver interface
- **aria_temporal_planner**: STN-specific MiniZinc solver integration
- **aria_membrane_pipeline**: Validation pipeline MiniZinc solver and template filters
- **aria_hybrid_planner**: Direct MiniZinc calls in temporal strategies

### Problems with Current Architecture

- **Code Duplication**: Multiple MiniZinc solver implementations with similar functionality
- **Inconsistent APIs**: Different interfaces for the same underlying MiniZinc operations
- **Scattered Dependencies**: MiniZinc-related dependencies spread across multiple apps
- **Testing Fragmentation**: MiniZinc tests distributed without comprehensive coverage
- **Maintenance Burden**: Updates to MiniZinc integration require changes across multiple apps

### MiniZinc Usage Patterns Identified

1. **STN (Simple Temporal Network) Solving**: Temporal constraint solving for timeline planning
2. **Multi-goal Optimization**: Planning optimization with multiple competing objectives  
3. **Validation Pipeline**: Comparing solver results for validation and testing
4. **Direct Template Execution**: Custom MiniZinc model execution with EEx templates

### Integer CP-SAT Problem Domain

All problems have been transformed into **integer CP-SAT (Constraint Programming - Satisfiability)** style solves, focusing on:

- **Integer finite domains** (no continuous variables)
- **Boolean and integer constraint satisfaction**
- **Optimization over integer variables**
- **SAT-based constraint solving**

## Decision

Extract all MiniZinc functionality into a dedicated `aria_minizinc` app that provides a unified, reusable interface for constraint solving across the entire project.

### Fallback Strategy for Integer CP-SAT Problems

Implement a **two-tier fallback system** to ensure reliable constraint solving even when MiniZinc is unavailable:

1. **Primary Solver**: MiniZinc (optimal performance for complex problems)
2. **Fallback Solver**: fixpoint (pure Elixir constraint programming solver)

**fixpoint Library Benefits:**

- **Pure Elixir** implementation (no external dependencies)
- **Integer finite domain variables** (perfect for CP-SAT problems)
- **Supports both CSP and COP** (constraint satisfaction + optimization)
- **Active development** (latest release June 2025)
- **Parallel and distributed solving** capabilities
- **Well-documented** with extensive examples (TSP, N-Queens, Knapsack)

**Fallback Implementation:**

- Automatic detection of MiniZinc availability
- Graceful degradation to fixpoint when MiniZinc unavailable
- Consistent API regardless of underlying solver
- Performance monitoring and solver selection optimization

## Notes

This extraction addresses a critical architectural need for consolidating scattered MiniZinc functionality. The comprehensive test suite with single responsibility principle ensures quality while the unified API provides consistency across all use cases.

The template system is particularly important as it provides the foundation for all constraint solving operations. Each template must have dedicated test coverage to ensure reliability.

Success depends on careful extraction of existing functionality while maintaining backward compatibility and improving the overall architecture.
