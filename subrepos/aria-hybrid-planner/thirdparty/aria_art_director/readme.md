### **INTELLIGENT CRITIQUES**

SYSTEM LEARNS "TASTE" FROM USER INTERACTIONS, TEXT, AND IMAGE MOOD BACKPACKS. FUNCTIONS AS AN ART CRITIC FOR AVATARS. THE SYSTEM USES A **TASTE-ENCODED COLOR DOT**, PLACED ON THE CHEST, TO IDENTIFY ISSUES IN CHARACTER DESIGNS AND EXPLAIN WHY THEY OCCUR. THE HYBRID PLANNER ENSURES THAT EACH DOT IS EXPLAINABLE, PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY IN CRITIQUES.

#### **HIGH-LEVEL EXAMPLE: THE USER'S PERSPECTIVE**

1. **USER GOAL.** USER PROVIDES A CHARACTER DESIGN FOR CRITIQUE: "EVALUATE THIS CUTE, FANTASY FOX-GIRL CHARACTER." THE SYSTEM ANALYZES THE DESIGN AND ASSIGNS A TASTE-ENCODED COLOR DOT TO HIGHLIGHT ISSUES AND PROVIDE EXPLANATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE INPUTS INCLUDE CHARACTER PARAMETERS, AN SVG FILE FOR EXTRUSION, AND A JSON-LD FILE EMBEDDED INTO THE GLTF USING THE XMP EXTENSION. THE OUTPUT IS A GLTF FILE WITH A MANDATORY SVG-TO-EXTRUSION COMPONENT, AN OPTIONAL 3D SCENE, AND OUTPUT JSON-LD EMBEDDED BACK INTO THE GLTF FILE USING THE XMP EXTENSION. SEE [RDF ELIXIR](https://rdf-elixir.dev/) FOR DETAILS.
2. **PLANNER TASK.** SYSTEM TRANSLATES GOAL TO PLANNER TASK: (CREATE-CHARACTER THEME: FANTASY, ARCHETYPE: FOX-PERSON, AESTHETIC: CUTE).
3. **PLANNER'S LEARNED TASTE.** PLANNER IS PRE-TRAINED. ITS DSL RULEBOOK CONTAINS LEARNED ASSOCIATIONS FOR CREATING HIGH-QUALITY TEXT DESCRIPTIONS.
4. **THE PLAN.** PLANNER DECOMPOSES TASK. GENERATES COMPLETE JSON OBJECT. ALL PARAMETERS CHOSEN FOR COHERENCE.
5. **GENERATION.** JSON FEEDS INTO PIPELINE. A DETAILED, HIGH-QUALITY TEXT DESCRIPTION IS CREATED.
6. **RESULT.** USER GETS A PROFESSIONAL-GRADE TEXT DESCRIPTION. NO MANUAL SLIDER ADJUSTMENT. AI ACTED AS A TEXT GENERATION SPECIALIST.

#### **LOW-LEVEL EXAMPLE: THE PLANNER'S KNOWLEDGE ENCODING**

1. **THE PUZZLE.** PLANNER MUST CRITIQUE FOOTWEAR IN A CHARACTER DESIGN. THEME IS TRADITIONAL_SHRINE_MAIDEN. THE PLANNER ASSIGNS A TASTE-ENCODED COLOR DOT TO IDENTIFY ISSUES, SUCH AS INAPPROPRIATE FOOTWEAR, AND EXPLAINS WHY THE DOT WAS ASSIGNED BASED ON TRAINING AND ENCODED RULES. THE OUTPUT GLTF FILE INCLUDES THE SVG-TO-EXTRUSION COMPONENT, CAN OPTIONALLY CONTAIN A FULL 3D SCENE, AND INCLUDES BOTH INPUT AND OUTPUT JSON-LD EMBEDDED USING THE GLTF XMP EXTENSION.
2. **UNTRAINED RULE.** INITIALLY, DSL RULE IS NAIVE. EQUAL CHANCE TO PICK ANY FOOTWEAR.
3. **TRAINING LOOP.**
   - **ATTEMPT 1:** PLANNER CHOOSES COMBAT_BOOTS. THIS CREATES A TEXT DESCRIPTION LIKE "...shrine maiden...wearing combat boots...".
   - **CRITIQUE 1:** ART RULER (LLM-AS-JUDGE) EVALUATES THE TEXT DESCRIPTION. JUDGES IT AS INCOHERENT. GIVES LOW REWARD (0.1).
   - **LESSON 1:** RL PENALIZES THIS CHOICE FOR THIS THEME.
   - **ATTEMPT 2:** PLANNER CHOOSES FANTASY_TRADITIONAL. TEXT DESCRIPTION IS "...shrine maiden...wearing traditional geta sandals...".
   - **CRITIQUE 2:** ART RULER JUDGES TEXT DESCRIPTION AS COHERENT AND HIGH-QUALITY. GIVES HIGH REWARD (0.95).
   - **LESSON 2:** RL REINFORCES THIS CHOICE.
4. **TRAINED RULE.** AFTER THOUSANDS OF CYCLES, ART UPDATES THE DSL. KNOWLEDGE IS ENCODED. THE RULE IS NOW WEIGHTED AND INTERPRETABLE.  
   \# METHOD: SELECT_FOOTWEAR_FOR_SHRINE_MAIDEN  
   \# DECOMPOSES INTO (WITH LEARNED WEIGHTS):  
   \- (0.95) SET_PARAMETER('footwear_item', 'FOOTWEAR_FANTASY_TRADITIONAL')  
   \- (0.04) SET_PARAMETER('footwear_item', 'FOOTWEAR_CASUAL_SHOES')  
   \- (0.01) SET_PARAMETER('footwear_item', 'FOOTWEAR_PRACTICAL_COMBAT_BOOTS')

   THE PLANNER'S "TASTE" FOR TEXT DESCRIPTION CRAFTING IS NOW AN EXPLICIT, READABLE RULE.
